	// let's match with a synthetic package that doesn't exist. We will create a new
	// package that matches the same name and version as what is contained in the
	// "sourceRPM" field.

	// Regarding RPM epoch and comparisons... RedHat is explicit that when an RPM
	// epoch is not specified that it should be assumed to be zero (see
	// https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/issues/450). This comment from
	// RedHat is applicable for a project that has elected to not use epoch and has
	// not changed their version scheme at all --therefore it is safe to assume that
	// the epoch (though not specified) is 0. However, in cases where there may be a
	// non-zero epoch and it has been omitted from the version string it is NOT safe
	// to assume an epoch of 0... as this could lead to misleading comparison
	// results.

	// For example, take the perl-Errno package:
	//		name: 		perl-Errno
	//		version:	0:1.28-419.el8_4.1
	//		sourceRPM:	perl-5.26.3-419.el8_4.1.src.rpm

	// Say we have a vulnerability with the following information (note this is
	// against the SOURCE package "perl", not the target package, "perl-Errno"):
	// 		ID:					CVE-2020-10543
	//		Package Name:		perl
	//		Version constraint:	< 4:5.26.3-419.el8

	// Note that the vulnerability information has complete knowledge about the
	// version and it's lineage (epoch + version), however, the source package
	// information for perl-Errno does not include any information about epoch. With
	// the rule from RedHat we should assume a 0 epoch and make the comparison:

	//		0:5.26.3-419.el8 < 4:5.26.3-419.el8 = true! ... therefore we are vulnerable since epoch 0 < 4.
	//                                                  ... this is an INVALID comparison!

	// The problem with this is that sourceRPMs tend to not specify epoch even though
	// there may be a non-zero epoch for that package! This is important. The "more
	// correct" thing to do in this case is to drop the epoch:

	//		5.26.3-419.el8 < 5.26.3-419.el8 = false!    ... these are the SAME VERSION

	// There is still a problem with this approach: it essentially makes an
	// assumption that a missing epoch really is the SAME epoch to the other version
	// being compared (in our example, no perl epoch on one side means we should
	// really assume an epoch of 4 on the other side). This could still lead to
	// problems since an epoch delimits potentially non-comparable version lineages.

	// let's match with the package given to us (direct match).

	// Regarding RPM epochs... we know that the package and vulnerability will have
	// well specified epochs since both are sourced from either the RPMDB directly or
	// the upstream RedHat vulnerability data. Note: this is very much UNLIKE our
	// matching on a source package above where the epoch could be dropped in the
	// reference data. This means that any missing epoch CAN be assumed to be zero,
	// as it falls into the case of "the project elected to NOT have a epoch for the
	// first version scheme" and not into any other case.

	// For this reason match exactly on a package we should be EXPLICIT about the
	// epoch (since downstream version comparison logic will strip the epoch during
	// comparison for the above mentioned reasons --essentially for the source RPM
	// case). To do this we fill in missing epoch values in the package versions with
	// an explicit 0.
