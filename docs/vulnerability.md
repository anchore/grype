## Vulnerability Summary

### Basic Grype Vulnerability Data Shape
````json
 {
   "vulnerability": {...},
   "relatedVulnerabilities": [...],
   "matchDetails": [...],
   "artifact": {...},
   "language": "",
   "licenses": [...],
   "cpes": [...],
   "purl": "",
   "metadata": {...}
````

#### Vulnerability
All information on the specific vulnerability that was directly matched on (e.g. ID, severity, CVSS score, fix information, links for more information).

#### RelatedVulnerabilities
Information pertaining to vulnerabilities found to be related to the main reported vulnerability. Maybe the vulnerability we matched on was a GitHub Security Advisory, which has an upstream CVE (in the authoritative national vulnerability database). In these cases we list the upstream vulnerabilities here.

#### MatchDetails
This section tries to explain what we searched for while looking for a match and exactly what details on the package and vulnerability that lead to a match.

#### Artifact 
This is a subset of the information that we know about the package (when compared to the [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft****) json output, we summarize the metadata section). 
This has information about where within the container image or directory we found the package, what kind of package it is, licensing info, pURLs, CPEs, etc.

#### Language
This section tries to explain the language ecosystem where the vulnerability was found ex: `CVE-2015-5237` is a vulnerability related to the Golang protobuf library so the language in this case would be "go".

#### Licenses
This section tries to enumerate all discovered licenses found associated with the package described under the `Artifact` section.

#### CPES
This section lists all CPE used to matched against vulnerability data found in the grype vulnerability database.

#### PURL

#### Metadata

#### Interesting subsections to investigate
- `artifact.locations[]`: files that are the "evidence" of the existence of the package (and related files from metadata that the evidence may have indicated)
- `artifact.type`: the packaging ecosystem which the package exists within, ex: `deb` indicates that the package probably installed by a dpkg or apt command.
- `vulnerability.dataSource`: this contains all the information for the vulnerability that we matched against
